# LanczosAlgorithm-Mathematica
Here we compute the Lanczos algorithm for operators in Hilbert Space. We aim to compute a minimal subspace that contains a operator at al times t.


We utilize the Quantum Algebra package in mathematica to compute the lanczos algorithm in operator space. The aim is to start out with an initial operator O in hilbert space and obtain an accurate picture of time evolution. This code works well for low enough dimensionality.
